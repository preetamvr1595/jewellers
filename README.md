# MGS Jewellerys Admin (scaffold)

This workspace contains a scaffolded Admin Dashboard for MGS Jewellerys.

Frontend (client): React + Vite + Tailwind
Backend (server): Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Cloudinary

Quick start

1. Install dependencies for client and server:

```
cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
```

2. Create `.env` in the project root or `server` with credentials (see `.env.example`).

3. Start server:

```
cd server
npm run dev
```

4. Start client:

```
cd client
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The backend provides protected routes under `/api/*` and an upload endpoint using Cloudinary. Replace Cloudinary env vars to enable uploads.
- This scaffold focuses on a luxury visual style (ivory background, gold accents, serif headings). Expand components and API integration as needed.
